stock price prediciton methods paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01137


get news input
news sentiment analysis: use finbert / transformers
predict longevity of news: short or long  term, if short term affect price for next month, if long affect on more months
fake news detection: use some model and decrease the score at grammar errors, if source inst reliable etc

combine sentiment and fake news scores


get ticker input
get ticker domain: sector = stock.info.get('sector'), industry = stock.info.get('industry')
get news domain: if some news are about the same domain of the ticker domain, apply more impact on the price, if not apply less
  (if about the specific company, increase some impact factor)
  use models like latent dirichlet / berttopic / gpt or use named entity recognition
get technical indicators for ticker (try to predict the technical indicators for future using some model for time series forecasting)
get macroeconomic indicators (try to predict indicators using for future using time series forecasting)


predict price using arima / lstm: if news not in domain of ticker, decrease most of the impact on the predicted price, if news about ticker domain adjust it with combined sentiment-credibility score, if longevity is short term, adjust only for short term 
  (1 month or few weeks) using some factor to be decreased and give less impact for the next months, if extracted longevity is long term
  the impact factor should decrease mildly for the next months
adjust prices predicted regarding the current technical indicators and macroeconomic indicators or predictions of theser
