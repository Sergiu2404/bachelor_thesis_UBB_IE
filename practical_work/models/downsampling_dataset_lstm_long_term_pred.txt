 Option 1: Downsample your data (e.g., monthly prices)
Yes — this is a smart move for long-term prediction:

Create a resampled version of your dataset — instead of daily prices, use monthly or weekly closing prices.

Then, feed that into the LSTM with an appropriate sequence length — for example:

12 months of past data (sequence length = 12) to predict the price 3 months into the future.

Advantages:

Less noise.

More focused on long-term trends (e.g., macroeconomic cycles, investor sentiment shifts).

Simpler model due to reduced sequence length.

✅ Option 2: Use features engineered for long-term signals
Instead of just price, include:

Moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day).

RSI, MACD.

Volume trends.

Sector indexes.

Economic indicators (GDP, interest rate forecasts).

These help the model grasp long-term behavior better than raw prices alone.
